# Word Guessing Game (Python)

This is a simple word guessing game written in Python.
It was created as part of my Python learning journey (Day 8).

## 🎯 How the game works
- The computer randomly selects a word from a list
- The player guesses one letter at a time
- Correct letters are revealed
- The player has 6 attempts to guess the word
- The game can be replayed multiple times

## 🧠 What I practiced
- Strings and string methods
- Loops and conditionals
- Lists
- Input validation
- Game logic and state

## ▶️ How to run
1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Run the file:
   ```bash
   python guess_word.py
  
🤝 Note

This project was developed while learning Python, with guidance and explanations from ChatGPT.
I understand the code and continue improving it step by step.

📌 Status

Beginner project – improving gradually.

“This project helped me understand how to structure a Python program using functions, loops, and validation. I plan to revisit it later to improve it further.”

Next steps (future): refactor further, add menu, read words from file.
